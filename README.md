# Stock-Prices-Prediction-ML-Deep-Learning
Use of  historical data about the stock prices of a publicly listed company.
We will implement a mix of machine learning algorithms to predict the future stock price of this company,
starting with simple algorithms like averaging and linear regression, and then moving on to advanced techniques like Auto ARIMA and LSTM.
